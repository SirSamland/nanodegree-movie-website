Project: Movie Trailer Website  - Sam Castilla
================================

What it is
-----------------------------------
A Movie Trailer Website that displays various movies, and their trailers when selected. This is the first Project as part of the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree. Requires Python v2.7 to be installed.


How to Run Project
------------------
Download the zip file, open the "entertainment_center.py" file, and press F5 to run. Alternatively, feel free to use the terminal, navigate to the directory by entering "python", and execute the file from there.


Extra Credit Description
------------------------
I've made minor edits to the fresh_tomatoes code provided by Udacity. These edits include a drop box shadow on the movie posters, a stationary background image on the site, and a different hover color.
